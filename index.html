                <h2>SONG LYRICS</h2>
                <p>Yeah, they say when we grow up
                  You'll understand when you're older
                  Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
                  If I'll ever let go of this
                  Say goodbye to the old me
                  We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
                  I know I could die any moment
                  If I do, just remember this
                  <br>
                  Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
                  You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?
                  Actions speak louder than words do, it's pretty quiet, isn't it?
                  Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections
                  <br>
                  Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
                  Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
                  Those people that cut you open just to watch you bleed
                  Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!
                  <br>
                  These people gon' tell you that you will never make it
                  Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
                  That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overrated
                  Hearing people say they miss the "old you, " it's crazy, ain't it?
                  <br>
                  And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one
                  I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements
                  When I die, I wanna know that I lived for a reason
                  Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in, no
                  <br>
                  Yeah, they say when we grow up
                  You'll understand when you're older
                  Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
                  If I'll ever let go of this
                  Say goodbye to the old me
                  We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
                  I know I could die any moment
                  If I do, just remember this
                  <br>
                  Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours
                  If money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor
                  If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?
                  The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nah
                  <br>
                  The real you is not defined by the size of your office
                  The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
                  You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
                  For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!
                  <br>
                  Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect
                  I fell in love with my pain, and I slept with my regrets
                  Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left
                  Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming back
                  <br>
                  I've always had a problem with relationships
                  But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
                  Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends
                  Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no
                  <br>
                  Yeah, they say when we grow up
                  You'll understand when you're older
                  Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know it
                  If I'll ever let go of this
                  Say goodbye to the old me
                  We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
                  I know I could die any moment
                  If I do, just remember this
                  <br>
                  Yeah, they say you got into music
                  You signed up to be hated
                  That's kinda weird 'cause I don't remember signing my name up
                  Coming from people that give advice but never take none
                  I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded
                  <br>
                  I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by
                  We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
                  It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside
                  My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!
                  <br>
                  I look at the world from a different angle
                  People change, even Satan used to be an angel
                  Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
                  Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
                  <br>
                  Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for you
                  Say you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you
                  Cut out the lies, stay close to people you know are loyal
                  Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!</p>
